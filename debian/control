Description: Library for working with the Google Reader Like API
 # ReadMe
 librssreader is based on the original work libgreader from Matthew Behrens <askedrelic@gmail.com>. And it is developer oriented python package. With simple configuration changes and little codes, we hope it would support all Google Reader Api Like Rss Readers like 'Inoreader/The old Reader/Feedly' etc. RSS Reader ain't dead yet! The library will support inoreader by default, and will be easy to extend to support other Rss Reader.
 .
 libgreader is a basic configurable Python library for authenticating and interacting with the unofficial Google Reader API. It currently supports all major user authentication methods (ClientLogin, OAuth2) and aims to simplify the many features that Google Reader offers.

 * Convenient functions and models for working with those endpoints
 * A modest integration test suite!
 .
 ## Usage

 It's as simple as:
